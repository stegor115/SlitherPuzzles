How to Play-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-The objective of this game is to lead the snake to the red "apple" or food.

-The snake only moves when the player chooses to move it. The player is in control of the head, and the 
tail follows the head, like a real snake. The catch is the snake is unable to move upward without climbing 
ontop of itself. 

-To do so, move left or right into the snake's own tail in order to climb up. The player will need to do 
this in order to reach the food and progress through the game.

Controls----------------------------------------------------------------------------
D or Right Arrow - Move snake's head to the right.
A or Left Arrow - Move snake's head to the left.
S or Down Arrow - Move snake's head downward.
R - Restart the level, useful if the snake gets stuck.

Other Notes-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-There is currently only one level, this will change.

-Retrieving the food doesn't actually do anything, this will change.

-The snake's head is meant to fall downward if not supported by the tail for more than one grid block, it
currently doesn't. This will change.

-The snake shouldn't be able to keep climbing to the point where the tail leaves the ground. This is not
a magical pixie snake or anything, so this will change.

-There is nothing preventing the snake from going off screen if it gets too high up, the snake should never
be able to get that high in the final version, so this isn't a concern.
